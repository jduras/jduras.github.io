## R Markdown
<!-- comment -->

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button in R Studio a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

A useful summary of RMarkdown syntax can be found here: <https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/>

## Formating Text

Enclose parts of text with asterisk to obtain change it to italics or bold: writing
`*this text is in italics*` and `**this text is bold**` will result in *this text is in italics* and **this part is in bold** when you knit the document. End a line with two spaces to start a new paragraph.  

To include a link use the following `[text for link](www.rstudio.com)` which yields [text for link](www.rstudio.com)   

Use hashtag to make headers: one for level 1 header as in `# Header 1`, two for level 2 e.g. `## Header 2`, etc:

# Header 1

## Header 2

### Header 3

To create lists starts each line with an asterisk or a dash, for numbered lists start the line with numbers.


## Math Formulas

To include math formulas you can use standard LaTeX syntax to obtain:

- for inline math write `$1+1=2$` to get $1+1=2$

- use `$$` before and after to get an equation
$$
    x + y = 3
$$

- for an equation array use
```
$$
\begin{aligned}
    x + y &= 3 \\
    x - y &= 2
\end{aligned}
$$
```
to obtain
$$
\begin{aligned}
    x + y &= 3 \\
    x - y &= 2
\end{aligned}
$$

For more details on LaTeX syntax please see <https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics>


## R Code and Output

You can embed chunks of R code in RMarkdown document easily: start a chunk of R code with three backticks followed by r in curly brackets, and end it with three backtips. For example, including the following four lines in an R Markdown document
```{r comment=NA, echo=FALSE}
cat("```{r}\nsummary(cars)\nplot(cars)\n```")
```
is going to run the `summary` and `plot` functions on `cars` dataset and produce the following output
```{r}
summary(cars)
plot(cars)
```



To include some result inline put the R expression between single backticks, for example including the following line in the R Markdown file
```{r comment=NA, echo=FALSE}
cat("The averege speed is `r mean(cars$speed)` mph.")
```
yields: The averege speed is `r mean(cars$speed)` mph.


To supress the R code, warnings, or results to be printed out for any chunk you can use chunk options `echo=FALSE`, `warning=FALSE` and `include=FALSE`. Thus for example if the R Markdown file contains the following chunk
```{r comment=NA, echo=FALSE}
cat("```{r}\nplot(cars$speed, type='o', xlab='', ylab='speed, in mph')\n```")
```
graph will be shown but the command used to create it is not going to be displayed

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars$speed, type='o', xlab='', ylab='speed, in mph')
```
